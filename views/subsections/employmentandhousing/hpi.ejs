  Since 1990, the House Price Index (HPI) and Average Earnings Index (AEI) in Jersey have diverged significantly.

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; padding-bottom: 1em;">
  The elevated housing unaffordability index (HAI) of 1.708 signifies a challenging landscape for the average resident in Jersey. 
  With house prices outpacing average earnings, accessing and maintaining housing becomes increasingly difficult, posing financial strains on individuals and potentially impacting overall economic well-being.
